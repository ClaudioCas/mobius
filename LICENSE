This is not free software.  It is "available" software.  You are free
to look at it, learn from it, distribute it to others and modify it for
personal use but you may not sell it or distribute modifications
without permission.

Not that you would want to anyway.  You would have to be freaking
insane to read this let alone understand it to the point where you
would feel comfortable changing it.  Still, if you have nothing better
to do and want to contribute to the development or use parts of it in
something else just contact me and I'm sure we can work something out.

How's that for a license?
