There are essentially three layers to this.

  1) MIDI Data Model
  2) Multi-Media Device Interfaces
  3) Sequencer

MIDI Data Model

Static MIDI Mapping

<MIDIMap>
  <!-- channel='*' means all channels not explicitly specified -->
  <ChannelMap channel='0'>
    <Event type='C' value='7' newType='N' value='36' newChannel='2'/>
  </ChannelMap>
</MIDIMap

Event:
  channel, type, value, velocity
  outChannel, outType, outValue
  - velocity doesn't change or is ignored
  - when mapping CC to Note, positive CC is On,
    0 is Off
  - when mapping Note to CC, On is 127 Off is 0,
    velocity is 127

Use case:
  CC 10
