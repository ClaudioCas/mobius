The Xcode samples in the 2.4 SDK are typically convoluted and use
a lot of options that don't seem to be necessary.

What I gleaned from this is that none of the compiler options
beyond the ones we're already using are necessary, though this
may be interesting:

    -mmacosx-version-min=10.4 

Of the linker flags only -bundle is necessary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPILER OPTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

/Developer/usr/bin/gcc-4.0 -x c++ 
    same as g++ ?

-arch ppc 
    we build both

-g 
-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk 
    already using these

-pipe 
    use pipes rather than temporary files for communication
    between stages of compilation, unnecessary

-Wno-trigraphs 
    no warnings about trigraphs in comments, unnecessary

-fpascal-strings 
    allow Pascal style string literals to be constructed, I don't
    think this is necessary for VST sources

-faltivec 
    This flag is provided for compatibility with Metrowerks CodeWarrior
    and MrC compilers as well as previous Apple versions of GCC.  It
    causes the -mpim-altivec option to be turned on.

-mpim-altivec (via -faltivec)
    Enable built-in compiler support for the syntactic
    extensions as well as operations and predicates defined in the
    Motorola AltiVec Technology Programming Interface Manual (PIM).
    This includes the recognition of "vector" and "pixel" as (con-
    text-dependent) keywords, the definition of built-in functions such
    as "vec_add", and the use of parenthesized comma expression as
    AltiVec literals.

    I doubt this is necessary for VST.    

-fasm-blocks 
    Enable the use of blocks and entire functions of assembly code
    within a C or C++ file.  The syntax follows that used in CodeWar-rior. 
    (APPLE ONLY)

    Not necessary for VST?

-O0 
    Do not optimize.  This is the default.

-Wreturn-type -Wunused-variable 
    common warnings

-fmessage-length=0 
    Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about n
    characters.  The default is 72 characters for g++ and 0 for the
    rest of the front ends supported by GCC.  If n is zero, then no
    line-wrapping will be done; each error message will appear on a
    single line.
  
-mtune=G4 
    Tune to cpu-type everything applicable about the generated code,
    except for the ABI and the set of available instructions.  The
    choices for cpu-type are:...many...

    Since we're building universal binaries, this can't be used?

-fvisibility-inlines-hidden 
    This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
    pointers to inline methods where the addresses of the two functions
    were taken in different shared objects.
    ???

-mmacosx-version-min=10.4 

    The earliest version of MacOS X that this executable will run on is
    version.  Typical values of version include 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3.9.

    This seems reasonable, but necessary?

-I/Users/jeff/dev/mobius/src/vst/vstsdk2.4/public.sdk/samples/vst2.x/mac/build/vst\ 2.4\ examples.build/Debug/again.build/again.hmap

    A precompiled header file?

-F/Users/jeff/dev/mobius/src/vst/vstsdk2.4/public.sdk/samples/vst2.x/mac/build/Debug 
    Adds the framework directory to the head of the header file search list.
    This is the output directory and doesn't seem to be necessary.

-I/Users/jeff/dev/mobius/src/vst/vstsdk2.4/public.sdk/samples/vst2.x/mac/build/vst\ 2.4\ examples.build/Debug/again.build/DerivedSources

    This doesn't exist, not sure what it does normally.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
LINKER FLAGS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

/Developer/usr/bin/g++-4.0 -o /Users/jeff/dev/mobius/src/vst/vstsdk2.4/public.sdk/samples/vst2.x/mac/build/Debug/again.vst/Contents/MacOS/again

    A normal g++ link into the final bundle directory

-L/Users/jeff/dev/mobius/src/vst/vstsdk2.4/public.sdk/samples/vst2.x/mac/build/Debug
    Not necessary for most examples since we don't build libraries?

-F/Users/jeff/dev/mobius/src/vst/vstsdk2.4/public.sdk/samples/vst2.x/mac/build/Debug
    Framework directory, I guess to be used in linking.  Not necessary

-filelist /Users/jeff/dev/mobius/src/vst/vstsdk2.4/public.sdk/samples/vst2.x/mac/build/vst\ 2.4\ examples.build/Debug/again.build/Objects-normal/ppc/again.LinkFileList 
    A list of .o files 

-arch ppc 

    we use both

-Wl,-Y,1455 
    -Wl,option  
    Pass option as an option to the linker.  If option contains commas,
    it is split into multiple options at the commas.

    -Y number (32-bit only)
        For  the  first  number undefined symbols, displays each file in
        which the symbol appears, its type and whether the file  defines
        or  references it (that is, the same style of output produced by
        the -y option). To keep the output manageable, this option  dis-
        plays at most number references.

    Whew, not sure why this is necessary.

-bundle 
    Produce a Mach-O bundle format file.  The headers are placed  in
    the first segment.  All sections are placed in their proper seg-
    ments and they are padded to the segment alignment.  This has  a
    file type of MH_BUNDLE.

    !! The secret sauce

-mmacosx-version-min=10.4
    The earliest version of MacOS X that this executable will run on
    This seems reasonable, but necessary?

-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk
    already using this
