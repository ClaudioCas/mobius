- Find a way to set AbstractAudioStream::mTraceDropouts from a script
  or init file so we don't have to change code to use it.  

- In the call to Pa_OpenStream in WinAudioInterface and MacAudioInterface,
  we're passing in a fixed block size, need to allow variable sizes.

- Need to stop using the "suggested latency" crap, let users pick block
  sizes and convert this into the necessary PA calls to get that size
