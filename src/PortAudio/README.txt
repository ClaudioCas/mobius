This directory contains two versions of PortAudio.  Mobius currently
uses v19 in 20071207.

The "old" subdirectory contains a slightly hacked older of v19.  I'm
not exactly sure where what date this was captured, it was probably
around 2005.  This was used with Mobius through December 2008.  

We don't need the old version any more but I'm keeping it around
for awhile to make sure we don't need the fix I made for buffer
size selection.
