
Deferred Jumps

  - certain functions always schedule a JumpPlayEvent before
    the main event if they need to change the playback location
    to compensate for latency

  - when we reach the JumpPlayEvent, need to ask the event and/or
    function what to do

    void Function::calculateJump(Event* jump, JumpChanges* next)
      - overloaded by each function

Generic jumpPlayEvent handler

  - calculate amount of true latency loss
  - save current state for undo
  - initialize JumpChanges object
  - derive changes to rate, recalculate latencies
    ! can this be pushed into the Functions too?

  - call parent Function to set JumpChanges

  - update rate, pitch, and reverse in the mOutput stream
  - adjust nextFrame for latency loss and wrapping
  - update layer and frame  (and save for undo)
  - update mMute and mPause based on JumpChanges


Function::getJumpChanges(Event* jump, JumpChanges* next)

Loop::adjustJump
  ! need to factor this out into generic sections, and
    Function specific sections




----------------------------------------------------------------------

Function

  scheduleMute
    schedulePlayJump(parent, MutePlayEvent)
    - used by Insert, should just schedule a generic Jump
      and handle it later

  ReplaceFunction
    schedulePlayJump(parent, parent->frame)
    - should be able to derive the frame from the parent event

  MuteFunction
    if SUSMuteRetrigger up
      schedulePlayJump(parent)
        set next Layer and frame
        - should be able to defer these!
    else
      schedulePlayJump(parent, MutePlayEvent)
      - toggles the mute      

  SpeedFunction
      schedulePlayJump(event, event->frame)
      - should be able to derive the frame

  RateFunction
  RateShiftFunction
      schedulePlayJump(event, event->frame)
      - should be able to derive the frame
      - rate saved in parent event      
  

  StartSongFunction
    Mute->scheduleEvent
      - immediate mute then schedules another StartSongEvent
    schedulePlayJump(event, MutePlayEvent)
    - only to come out of Mute mode

  SlipFunction
    schedulePlayJump(event)
    - not working?

Loop

scheduleModeEndPlayJump
  schedulePlayJump
  - plus all kinds of shit

scheduleReverse
  - this one is weird, should be completely in Function
  - schedulePlayJump(event, ReversePlayEvent)

confirmSwitch
  schedulePlayJump(mSwitch)
  - generic jump analyzed later

switchEvent
  schedulePlayJump(mute, MutePlayEvent)
  - added to the end of the next loop if function=SamplePlay

finishReturnEvent
  scheduleJumpPlay(re)
  - added in front of a ReturnEvent, sort of like a switch
  - sets layer and frame after scheduling
