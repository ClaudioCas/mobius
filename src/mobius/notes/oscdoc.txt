some familiarity with OSC this should give you what you need.

First it is important that you use an OSC device that can be
programmed to send out any OSC address.  Older versions of
TouchOSC couldn't do that, they could only send fixed
addresses like "/1/toggle1" or "/2/push12".  I believe
newer versions of TouchOSC can send any address but I 
have not used them.

All Mobius target addresses begin with:

   /mobius

The first container under /mobius is the scope which may be "global",
a track number, or a group letter.  Examples:

   /mobius/global
 
   /mobius/1

   /mobius/A

Tracks are identified by number from 1 to 8.  Groups are identified
by latter from A to D (or however many groups you have configured).

Next we have a target type which is one of these: function, control,
parameter, setup, preset, bindings, uicontrol, uiconfig.

   /mobius/global/function
   /mobius/global/control

After the target type is a target name which would be the name
of a function, control, or configuration object.

So an OSC binding for the Record function on the selected track
(global scope) would look like:

   /mobius/global/function/Record

The "global" keyword is optional so this is the same:

   /mobius/function/Record

If you want an OSC binding for a specifc track use a track
number in the path.  This will do the record only in track 1.

   /mobius/1/function/Record

The controls look like this:

   /mobius/control/inputLevel
   /mobius/control/outputlevel
   /mobius/control/feedbck
   /mobius/control/pan

Parameters look like this:

   /mobius/parameter/subcycles

The argument that you include with the OSC path will be a float from 0
to 1.  We will automatically scale this to 0-127 for use with controls.

So this will set the output level to 127 (highest)

   /mobius/control/outputLevel 1.0

and this will set it to 64 (center)
 
   /mobius/control/outputLevel 0.5


If you have a device that must send out a fixed set
of OSC addresses, it is possible to map these into Mobius
addresses inside Mobius, but it's complicated and requires
a lot of XML writing.  If anyone needs it I'll publish it.
