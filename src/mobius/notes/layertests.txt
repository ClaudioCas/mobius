
Fundamental Layer/Audio Test Plan

Perform these tests after any significant change to the Layer, Audio,
or AudioCursor models or in the way blocks of frames are processed by
Track, Loop, and Stream.

TODO: When we apply deferred fades on an Undo, could instead try to set
up dynamic fades like segments do, so when we redo we can return 
to seamless audio.


Initial State:
  - layer flattening off
  - reverse off
  - speed off

Status:

   normal/reverse/speed/continuous feedback
   OK/OK/OK

* Record
  Basic record from a sample, check for fades on both ends.
  Check QuickSave.
  OK/OK/OK

* Overdub
  Overdub one or two isolated regions.  Check for fades on edges.
  Check QuickSave and project layer save.
  OK/OK/OK

* Record/Overdub
  End record with overdub, defer fade.
  OK/OK/OK
  bug: half speed color overrides overdub color in thermometer
  BUG: click in CF mode

* Record/Overdub/Undo/Redo
  Undo and apply fade, redo and recalculate segment fades.
  Will no longer have a seamless overdub.
  Reverse: Also undo while playing in the opposite of the record direction.
  OK/OK/OK

* Replace Center
  Check edge fades.
  OK/OK/OK

* Substitute Center
  Check edge fades.
  OK/OK/OK

* Replace Overlapping
  Start a replace toward the end and let it continue into the next layer.
  Should be like a seamless overdub.  Check Undo & Redo
  Undo/Redo will cause a bump because the deferred fade is applied.
  OK/OK/OK

* Substitute Overlapping
  Start a substitute toward the end and let it continue into the next layer.
  Should be like a seamless overdub.  Check Undo & Redo
  OK/OK/OK

* Replace Occlusion Fade Left
  Use an overlapping replace to create seamless content over the loop boundary.
  Do an overdub to add another layer to push the deferred fades back
  another level.  Perform a quantized replace to occlude the end of the layer.
  Must force a segment fade at the start.
  OK/OK/OK

* Replace Occlusion Fade Right
  Same setup as before but replace on the left.
  This uncovered a very complicated problem with fade tails and the need
  to maitain an offset.  
  OK/OK/OK

* Multiply
  Basic multiply, with and without overdubs.
  OK/OK/OK
  BUG: In CF, getting permanent at the multiply end point.  Was in
  expert mode, but I don't think it matters.

* ReMultiply
  Remultiply to splice out cycles.
  OK/OK/OK

* Unrounded Multiply, Trim Start, Trim End
  Splice out one cycle.  
  OK/OK/OK

* Insert
  Basic insert, watch for fades on edges.  Check with loop quant.
  OK/OK/OK

* Unrounded Insert
  bug: Getting new layer on each insert.  Need to accumulate these
  till the layer plays to the end, like Replace.
  OK/OK/OK
 
* Stutter
  Basic stutter, check for fades.
  OK/OK/OK

* StartPoint
  Basic start point, check fades.
  OK/OK/OK

* SUSMute
  Do lots of short mutes.
  OK/OK/OK
  BUG: It's hard to reproduce but if we come out of mute almost exactly
  on the loop boundary, get a click.

* Record/NextLoop
  End recording with NextLoop.  Recording fades, enter reset.
  OK/OK/OK

* Record/NextLoop, AutoRecord=On
  End recording with NextLoop.  Make sure initial fade applied.
  OK/OK/OK

* Record/NextLoop, LoopCopy=Sound
  Make sure initial and trailing fades applied.
  OK/OK/OK

* Record/NextLoop, LoopCopy=Timing
  Initial loop faded properly.  Next cycle set correctly.
  OK/OK/OK

* Trigger
  Modify a layer, once with structure, once with simple overdub.
  Any form of retrigger or loop switch must shift before switching.

* Feedback
  Make a basic recording a lower feedback.  New layers are created,
  but they all reference the original audio.
  OK/OK/OK


Again in Reverse!
Again in Half Speed!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Complex Tests

* Retrigger before the flattening finishes, make sure ending feedback
  is stored in the Segments and applied properly.

* Retrigger before the flattening finishes, but within the tail fade range.
  Complete the feedback copy even though we didn't advance to the end.

* Reverse direction during overdub

* unrounded multily (trim) forces deferred fade

* go from Overdub into Multiply/Insert then back to Overdub, local
  recording needs to carry over seamlessly

* create a layer with deferred head/tail, then multiply and insert
  make sure fades are deferred if continuous and applied if discontinuous

* end a loop in overdub and begin an Insert on frame 0, this should
  defer fades between the two layers, but is this ok if we're going
  to immediately insert a cycle?

* end a loop in overdub and begin a Multiply on frame 0, this should
  defer fades between the two layers, but is this ok if we're going
  to immediately multiply a cycle?

* In Test19 getting a bump at the start of each stutter because
  we're capturing a fade tail after jumping from the end of cycle 2
  to the start of cycle 1.  Since cycle 3 has a fast attack, we hear this
  on each stutter.  This only happens during recording, not in the resulting
  loop.  Difficult to prevent this since we don't know for sure if the
  end of any given cycle fades to zero.  Will have to keep track of the
  last "played" frame and only if they were all zero can we skip the fade
  tail.  This should be handled by OutputStream.
