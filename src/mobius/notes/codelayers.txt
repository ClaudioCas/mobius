UI/Protocols
  UI, MIDI, Osc, Keyboard, Buttons
  doesn't much matter what is out here

MobiusInterface
  called by UI
  MobiusInterface, Function, Parameter, Controller, Binding
  !! avoid exposing Track and Loop

Mobius
  implements Mobius, manages MobiusCore and MobiusThread
  pases events to MobiusCore from the outside world

MobiusCore
  all code "in the interrupt"
  Synchronizer, Track, Loop, Layer, Segment


Utility
  code with no Mobius dependencies, could be used elsewhere
  Audio

----------------------------------------------------------------

Function
  Needs to be accessible from the UI so it can present binding windows, 
  UI builds FunctionContext and calls doFunction.

  Static objects that mostly don't change.  

     - display name set after reading the catalog
     - focusLockDisabled set from global parameter
     - cancelMute set from global parameter

     the two booleans can be phased in by MobiusCore, 
     !the displayName has concurrent access issues, both UI and core logging
     might be using it

Changing Presets

UI preset menu
    currently calling Mobius::setPreset(Preset)
      should be doing this by number or name from the menu?

    currently calling Track::setPreset which does a copy
      ! need mPendingPreset number that gets converted to a Preset
        from mInterruptConfig


 


UI configuration editor


MIDI event bound to preset,
