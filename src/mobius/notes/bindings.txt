
New Binding Dialog

There are way more things we can bind than actual bindings, it is hard
to see what the overall bindings are.  Well, with the track/group
multipliers there can be lots of bindings too.

Method 1: Binding List Oriented

Bindigns List: tall panel on the right containing a list of all
bindings.  Sort by Trigger/Target or Target/Trigger?  New/Delete
button at the bottom.

Delete button deletes the selected binding.
New button creates a new binding, if one is selected it creates
a copy?

Once a binding is selected the target is scrolled into position
and the trigger parameters are displayed for editing.

<MidiConfig>

  <MidiBinding name='Record' status='note' value='0'/>

  <FunctionBinding name='Record' status='note' value='0'/>

  <ControllerBinding name='inputLevel' value='6'/>


Function bindings: one shot or sustaned "on and off" things
  - controllable with notes, CC's, or programs
 
Controller bindings: continuous value things
  - controllable with CC's only
    (but could allow pitch bend, and aftertouch)



  <ControllerBinding name='group1Input' value='6'/>
  <ControllerBinding name='group1Output' value='6'/>
  <ControllerBinding name='group1Feedback' value='6'/>
  <ControllerBinding name='inputLevel' value='6'/>
  <ControllerBinding name='inputLevel' value='6'/>

  inputLevelGroup1
  outputLevelGroup1

  <ControlGroup name='global'>
    <ControllerBinding name='inputLevel' value='6'/>
  </ControlGroup>

  <ControlGroup name='group1'>
    <ControllerBinding name='inputLevel' value='6'/>
  </ControlGroup>
  
  <ControlGroup name='group2'>
    <ControllerBinding name='inputLevel' value='6'/>
  </ControlGroup>

Hierarchical is nice conceptually but we still have the flattening
problem for display.  Flat naming convention is easy.  

We lose full-blown Parameter status but that's ok since you don't
need to change these in scripts, just select a different config.

Also works for track bindings:

  <ControllerBinding name='inputLevelTrack1' value='6'/>

Controller
  - like Function, defines a base controller
  - some may be static, others multiplied

Controllers
  - runtime expanded list of Controller objects for statics, tracks and groups
