Looperlative Forum Notes

----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Well here's a couple of suggestions (as you asked ), which I hope fit
with what's there already.  I'm not too familiar with what's already
in place, so this could be nonsense.

1) when "Mult Amount" = 1, then it's possible to tap in the no. of
times to mult the loop.  eg. Tap 3 times quickly, and loop is mult by
3. Or would 1 tap = 2x, 2 tap=3x ?  By quick, I mean less than 300ms
between taps

2) Just as hitting "Play" on an empty loop creates a synced loop,
hitting Mult should give you an instant record onto a Multiplied Loop.
So instead of Play>Mult>OD you only need "Mult"

3) If you really want EDP type functionality, then hitting mult on an
empty loop will start a record. The recording continues while
Looperlative waits for another button press.  After that press then
recording continues until the new loop is a multiple of the master
loop. It would probably suit the user to see a display of the mult
amount as it increments.

hope that's comprehensible

Personally, i'd be happy to manage without 3).  With my edps I get the
wrong no. of mults more often than I'd like anyway

Suggestion 2) seems like it would be easy to implement.  Instead of
having 2 footcontroller buttons, one with "Play>Mult>OD" and one with
"Mult" there'd only need to be "mult" for the same functionality.


1)&2) could work together for a very neat interface.


Maybe there are a number of possibilities for button presses on empty
loops.
