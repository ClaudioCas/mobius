This was on the laptop dated 5/31/2006

I think it was an earily attempt to codify the bug list that never
went anywhere.

The Mobius List


This file contains a list of most known bugs and feature requests that
have been identified by Mobius users and discussed on the Yahoo group.

I hope this list will serve three purposes: 

  - to remind us of all the things we've discussed so we don't forget them
  - to inform new users about the problems we've already identified
  - to help prioritize what we should work on next

I have not been able to review all of the forum posts and emails that
I've received over the past year so I know there are some things
missing or things that I'm not remembering correctly.  Currently the
list contains things discussed since about January 2006.  I will be
adding more as I review older notes.  Feel free to post corrections to
the group or to me privately at jeff@zonemobius.com.

The file is divided into these sections:

  - Current Priorities
  - Bug Reports
  - Engine Feasures
  - User Interface Features
  - VST Issues

I am not publishing many of the issues related to scripting since they
are hard to describe and are only of interest to a few people.  I'll 
publish a seperate file that goes into detail on scripting issues.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Current Priorities
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains brief descriptions of the items being worked
on for the next few releases, in approximate order of priority.
More information on each item can be found in the sections below.

  - parallel scripts
  - clicks during pitch shifting
  - clicks while changing feedback at the loop point



----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug Reports
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains a list of most known reported bugs.  I may
choose not to publish a bug if it is obscure and not likely to be seen
by most users.  Items prefixed with "UI:" indiciate user interface bugs.

- Realign with TrackSyncMode not working in scripts (Per)
    Verify that Realign can be used in scripts to resync all brother  
    tracks with the master.

- When pumping feedback over the loop point for a layer    
    with deferred edge fades, clicking can occur (Per).

- Functions after bounce run in muted tracks (Matthias)
    "it seems, after a bounce any new function is executed by all resetted
     tracks"

- Can decrease but not increase Loop Count (Matthias)
    Unable to increase loop count in the isntant parameter list.
    Internally might be reset to the value in the Preset.

- Sample play gets confused if run twice before completion (Matthias)
    "When running SamplePlay the loop plays once and then goes to mute. 
     When running sample Play a second time before the end of the loop, 
     a "mute" is scheduled somewhere in the middle of the loop, the loop
     retriggers and goes to mute at the point where the mute is scheduled?"

- GlobalMute after NextLoop (Matthias)
    "after doing next loop to come from the last loop to the first, 
     Global Mute will only work the second time you run it"
     GlobalMute state might not be maintained properly when switching
     among loops? 

- Loop trigger functions should not take you out of Mute (Per)
    Certainly not during the switch quantize period, may want it
    configurable whether it unmutes after the switch is complete.

- Sync=HostBar not working properly in Live (chapdabeat)
    Record an audio clip, use that as the sync master for Mobius.

- TrackCopy with TimeCopyMode=Overdub is broken (Per)

- TrackCopy in scripts can target the wrong track (Matthias)
    The "Wait last" statement may not be properly waiting for
    the track switch to complete, so functions intended to be run
    in the next track are run in the old track.

- Tracks in both mute and half speed not in right color (Luca)
    Sometimes tracks are displayed in the half speed color when
    they should be in the mute color if in both modes.

- UI: Mouse button release lost when drifting outside window (Ben)
    If you hold down a button and move it outside the window, the
    button up transition can get lost and we still think we're
    noving a knob.  Need to set "mouse capture".

- UI: Garbage line in the MIDI bindings dialog (Matthias)
    Under some conditions, the names for the functions get corrupted
    and display funny.  It was probably the name of a script.
    File posted on the Yahoo group.

- Selecting MIDI Config with notes (Per)
    Two scripts bound to MIDI notes.  The scripts use "set midiConfig"
    with the names of two configurations.  You can switch from the
    initial configuration to the other one, but not back again. 
    (unverified)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Engine Features
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Option to fully reset a track when starting a new recording (Luca)
    Currently we keep the old layers in case you want to undo.

- Option to set all track controls to 100% on a Reset (Luca)

- Script Templates (Per)
    Basically the ability to call a function indirectly as the value
    of a variable rather than written directly into the script.  Allows
    you to write script "templates" that are then called by other scripts
    that pass the names of the functions to be called within the
    control logic.

- Time Slip (Per)
    SlipForward, SlipBackward with SlipMode parameter defining
    the amount of slip.

- Scripts calling external programs or batch files (Ben)

- Scripts statement for sending arbitrary MIDI events (rafko_m)

- Audio Recorder needs to include all VST output ports (Per)
    Currently including only the first set of stereo ports.

- Audio Recorder needs option to include the input signal (Andrew)
    The input signal is not currently included in the recording even
    if you have the "monitor input" parameter set.

- Audio Recorder needs option to save a different file for each track (Per)
    Currently all tracks are merged and saved in a single file.

- Full mono tracks (many)
    Track only uses one input channel and one output channel, loop data
    uses half the amount of memory.

- Mono input tracks, true stereo panning (many)
    A track uses one input channel, half memory, but two output channels
    so input signal can be panned in stereo.

- Record obeys focus lock (should already work, check).
    If TrackSyncMode is on, it needs to be ignored when doing 
    synchronized recording with focus lock or groups.

- Track Mute mode (Doug, Per, others)
    A higher level mute that is more like a mute on a mixing console
    rather than the "musical mute" provided by mute mode.  Track mute
    silences the track, but does not affect the looping mode, for example
    you can be overdubbing and multiplying silently during track mute.

- Instant Track Copy (Doub)
    Function to immediately copy one track to another, leaving you in
    the original track with the new track muted.  Similar to TrackCopy=Sound
    but you don't have to switch tracks.  Also an option to copy, mute
    the source track, and move to the new track maintaining the current
    position.

- Script Confirmation (Per)
    An option on scripts (and maybe functions?) that will schedule it
    as a pending event, then activate it immediately after the *next* 
    function.  Sort of like Switch Confirmation.  Invoking the script again
    can cause it to modify the eventual behavior.  The use case was to be
    able to tap in a particular rate with up/down then trigger the
    shift with another function.

    !confirm
      When the script is run for the first time it is held as pending  
      and will not run until some other function comes in.  Undo
      will cancel the pending script.  The script is run before
      the triggering function.

    !confirm after
      The script is run after the triggering function.

    The automatic variable "confirmation" will be set to the name
    of the triggering function that could be used in conditionals.

- Retro Active Bounce (Per)
    A variant of bounce recording that copies the last x bars that were
    played to a new track.  Similar to how Musolomo finds the start of the
    loop by quantizing backward.

- Bounce Source (Matthias?)
    Specifies the inputs to the bounce recording as just the tracks in
    focus or the tracks in a group rather than all audible tracks.
    Makes it sound less obvious to the audience what is happening.
    - BounceSource=All|Focused|Group1|Group2...

- BPM Selection Range (Ben)

    Overloading 8thsPerCycle to specify Sync=Out BPM is inconvenient if
    the desired tempo doesn't match the desired quantization boundary.
    One option is to specify a BPM range, and automatically pick the one
    that fits best ignoring 8thsPerCycle (Ben's preference).
    Another is to add a new beatsPerMeasure parameter that lets you
    specify the sync beats without changing quantization.

- Tempo Divisor Control (Per)
    Ability to assign a CC to the beatsPerMeasure parameter.
    Used to adjust the tempo of the slave device in musically
    useful multiples.
  
    Also talked about a way to tie RateShift into it to make it more
    like Time Stretch.  

- Temporary Bypass Focus Lock (Per)
    After setting up focus lock and track groups, sometimes convenient
    to disable it temporarily to work on an independent track, then
    put it back remembering all the previous settings.  

- Smart Switch Quantize (Per)
    If the next loop is empty, quantize is forced to Confirm, otherwise it is 
    the configured value.  This could be made totally general or just
    a flag like EmptySwitchConfirm=true.

- Instant LoopCopy (Per)
    With SwitchQuant=Off and LoopCopy=Timing, if you do NextLoop
    rapidly several times, all he intermediate loops should now have an
    empty loop of the correct size, presumably the same for LoopCopy=Sound.
    You don't have to wait for Insert Mode to finish roudning.
  
- Feedback Effects Loop (Dmitry, Per, others)
  Additional VST pins for send and return.
  Functions:
    FeedbackEffectToggle
    FeedbackEffectOn
    FeedbackEffectOff
  Or as Per suggests, a FeedbackEffectSendLevel (and maybe a ReturnLevel)?
  for continuous control over the amount of effect fed back.  Actually
  a dry/wet mix level too.

- Feedback Effects Loop using alternate ASIO device (Dmitry)
  Like the extra set of VST pins, but can be used in standalone Mobius
  with hardware effects.

- Bounce Cancel (Matthias)
  Pressing Undo during a bounce does not cancel the bounce since
  it could be part of the performance being bounced.
  Either need a Bounce Cancel function, a parameter that makes Undo
  perform a cancel, or maybe a long press of something.

- Bounce Undo (Matthias)
  After the bounce has been performed, a way to undo the bounce
  and restore the source tracks.  Requires that we save state and
  invalidate the "undoability" after manual changes are made to the
  source tracks.

- Synchronizing playback of newly loaded loops (Ben)
  When you load a loop, it enters a pause mute.  If another
  track is the sync master, need a way to unpause the loop we just
  loaded in sync with the master track.  TrackSyncMode only
  works for recording right now.

- Synchronizing playback of project tracks after loading (Ben)
  When you load a project containing multiple tracks, all
  tracks will be in a pause mute.  Need a way to unmute all of them
  at once.
  
  Possibly addressed by a TriggerSync=true parameter that
  means that any form of retrigger will wait for the
  time determined by TrackSyncMode.

- Global Feedback Control (dsneed)
  An easy way not involving scripts or focus lock to control
  the feedback for all tracks, useful for a "fade out" of whatever
  happens to be playing.

- Store current minor modes (reverse, speed, rate) in project (Matthias)
  Treat these like track controls.

- Math operators in scripts (Matthias)
  
- Script event handlers (Matthias)
  Special labels called automatically when certain things happen
  (on_function, on_leaveTrack, on_otherScript)

- MakeLoop script function to create a loop of a particular size (Matthias)
  Perhaps this should be implemented as an argument to Clear?

- "Lock Playback Parameters" option as an alternative to transfer modes (Per)
  Transfer modes remember the state of a loop when you leave it and
  restore it when you return, but since this is defined by the preset, it
  applies to all loops in the track.  A more flexible option would be to 
  decide on a per-loop basis whether to remember playback modes by 
  "locking" them before leaving the loop.  Will need a graphical indicator.

- Automatic compression to help prevent input overload (Ben, Mark)
  It's easy to overload a Mobius track with a hot signal, especially
  when overdubbing.  

- Clean up scripts directory (Jeff)
  Weed out some of the older scripts that we don't need, and fix
  the ones we do.  Integrate some of the really useful scripts like
  Matthias' multi-track mute/retrigger script.

- Ability to set fixed feedback levels from key and MIDI bindigns (Ben)
  example A->track1:feedback=100%, B->track2:feedback=50%

- FeedbackUp/FeedbackDown functions with configurable increments

- Restore ability to have an Omni channel for bindings (Matthias)
  
- Ability to bind more than one MIDI event to the same function/script (Jeff)


----------------------------------------------------------------------
User Interface Features
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Visual indication of input overload (Ben)
  When an overload does occur, do something visually so the performer
  knows they need to undo that layer before it plays and the 
  overload distortion is heard.

- configurable buttons in the track strip, usually for scripts (Ben)

- Spread Sheet View (Ben, Per) 
  Column for each track cell for each loop cell color shows status
  (empty, overdub, speed, etc.), loop length.   Click to trigger cells.
  MIDI triggers for direct access cells.

- Controller Inc/Dec with focus (Ben)
  The ability to select one of the controlles (feedback, pan, etc)
  then change their value using a pair of inc/dec keys. 
  
- Popup message when parameters are changed with MIDI or scripts (Ben)
  Sometimes hard to keep track of feedback levels 8thsPerCycle
  and other things that can be changed by MIDI or scrpits.

- Open to temporarily apply changes made in the Preset dialog (Ben)
  Rather than always making the changes permanent, use the Preset 
  dialog as an editor for all the temporary parameters. 

- Mysterious problem with accidental function bindings after trying
  to make a scoped binding. (Per)

- Track Configuration Objects & Menu (Matthias)

  Rather than load projects from a file, make them a more built-in
  concept like Presets and MIDI Configurations.  Can have a pull down
  menu to select projects, and assign program changes to them.  At
  least to this for project templates.

  Call these "Track Configurations" which contain:
    - selected track
    - for each track
       - vst input and output ports
       - initial track control values
       - global mute and solo status
       - focus lock and group number
       - initial reverse, speed, rate, pitch, overdub 

  There would then no longer be a default project template, you would
  simply mark one of the Track Configuration objects as the default.

  When you Reset a track, return to the defaults in the track config.

- Option to keep the Mobius VST window on top always (dsneed, Matthias)
  call setWindowPos() with the const wndTopMost

- Changing instant parameter values (or any select field actually)
  with the mouse wheel. (Matt)

- Keyboard bindings should support "scopes" like MIDI bindings

- Clicking in the loop list to trigger a loop (Matthias)

- Clicking in the layer list to undo or redo to a specific layer (Matthias)

- Display a loop list in each track strip (Matthias)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
VST Issues
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- crash in SawStudio if you delete the Mobius plugin and create it again 
  (dsneed)

- crash under FLStudio v6

- doesn't work under Band-In-A-Box (fliptop2)

- better behavior when trying to run more than one VST instance in a host
  (dsneed)

- Using "reinit" in Bidule, double clicking on Mobius caused error (Matthias)
    Runtime Error: R6025 - pure virtual function call

- Support for plugin synchronization in Bidule (richiehamel)
  Bidule is one of the few hosts that allows plugins to generate
  clocks, this is more convenient than using MIDIYoke.
