Transition Script Wait Events During Loop Switch


Original algorithm removed the switch frame as the 
event basis and then added the delta relative to the new frame:

    newFrame = (event->frame - originalLoop->getFrame()) + nextLoopFrame

The problem is that if the event was scheduled prior to the loop frame
the result would go negative.

This only happens in a script if you wait immediately after doing
a  loop switch and don't do "Wait last" to wait for the switch
to complete:

    PrevLoop
    Wait until subcycle 1

The wait will be scheduled relative to original loop, then the SwtichEvent
will be processed and we have to carry the ScriptEvent over to the
next loop.  In 2.0, it doesn't really carry over since events are maintained
at the track level but it does potentially need to be adjusted for the
size of the new loop.

The following waits are not used:

  none, event, up, long

The following waits do not schedule events:

   last, function, switch, script, block, thread

The following waits schedule pending events:

   start, end, externalStart, driftCheck, pulse, beat, bar, realign, return

These wait types schedule non-pending events:

   time, until

Wait type "time" is used for relative waits and is the default:

   Wait msec 1000
   Wait frame 1000
   Wait cycle
   Wait subcycle

Wait type "until" is internally WAIT_ABSOLUTE.

  Wait until subcycle 1

In both of the time and until waits, a frame is calculated relative to
the loop that was active at the time the Wait event was evaluated.

Ideally we would reschedule the Wait relative to the new loop length.
We almost have enough because we save the wait type in the Event but 
we've lost the unit.  For example if the wait is "Wait until subcycle 1"
this might be at frame 22000 in the original loop but 40000 in the
next loop because it is longer.  We don't carry enough information
in the Event to recalculate this.

Instead, the best we can do is calculate the remaining wait time 
and wait the same amount of time in the next loop.  For relative waits
this will be the same if the loops are the same size.  Absolute waits
effectively become relative waits and won't be as accurate.
