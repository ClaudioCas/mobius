
Function Specific Overrides

  - group & focus lock (currently a global)
  - mute cancel (currently global)
    - still worth having muteCancelMode in Preset?

  - quantize 
    - could be used instead of bounceQuantize and overdubMode
      and switchQuantize
  - 8thsPerCycle (only if Quantize=subcycle)

Mode Specific Overrides
 
  - ignore secondary feedback


The thing I don't like about 8thsPerCycle and Quantize overrides
is that it's easy enough to do in a script.  Instead of playing
the save/restore variable game, how about a new argument syntax

    Insert quantize=off 
    Multiply quantize=subCycle,subCycles=16

Focus Lock could work similarly

    Insert focusLock=off
    Insert groupLock=off

Or more proactively

    Insert group=A

Mute Cancel can work this way but much more tedious than global config
    
    Retrigger muteCancel=off
