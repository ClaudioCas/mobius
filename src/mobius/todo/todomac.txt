* Host sync

* need nicer status message if functions are performed before connecting
  any audio pins rather than just hanging

* figure out what "Mode" means in bidule: Processing, Mute, Bypass

VST
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Escape binding for Move Display Components not working
  - it closes the window, may be nothing we can do

- exit of the VST frame isn't shutting down properly?
  - still some odd memory corruption in Reaper

- key/midi help dialogs displaying funky, they show briefly then
   are hidden under the Mobius window, but you can bring them to the front
   something to do with being non-modal, setting window group now working?

Display
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- save/load not tested

- MIDI Devices: nice to scroll to the current selection

- white event triangle not filled in

Qwin
  - Change MacContext and MacFont to allow two types of sizing,
    image and typographic.

  - rework the "main" routine to be more exposed to the app like
    we're now doing for VSTs

Menus
----------------------------------------------------------------------

File->Open Loop
  start in the installation directory, remember previous selection,
  filter for .wav files

File->OpenProject
  same as Open Loop but filter for .mop files

File->Save Loop
File->Save Project
File->Save Project Template
  start in installation directory (or user directory)

File->Save Quick
  didn't save file?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Convert .ico files to .icns files and put in Resources.
The format can be "any supported type" name needs to be 
the bundle name (the top level bundle directory) so we 
need to change this from "bundle" to "Mobius".

Normally application files that can be edited go here
according to Carbon Wiki:

  It's recommended that application data live in your application
  bundle's "Resources" folder, which you can access using
  CFBundleCopyResourceURL(), or if it needs to be editable, needs to be
  extracted or is an optional install, in the user's Application Support
  folder in their Library folder.

Most of my apps put things in Application Support, not sure I want 
to mess with that. Just leave everythign in Resources?
