Sync Bugs
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* With AutoRecord, Sync=Out, can start the MIDI clocks immediately

* AutoRecord, Sync=Out, RecordBeats=4, RecordBars=2
  Getting an 8 beat loop but only one cycle.
  !! Crash after trying to set initial cycles

* Crash in interrupt handler always seems to hang now, need
  to catch and terminate more gracefully.

* Synchronizer::localStartPoint
  - looks like it needs to be closer to doRealign in handling
    the pending RealignEvent

* QuantMidiStartPoint, MuteRealign
  - various problems 
  - "corrected play request by 33 frames"

* Synchronizer::loopLocalStartPoint(Loop* l)
  is this still used or do we do it all in syncPulsePlaying

* InstantDivide, eventually calls Synchronizer::loopEndDivide
  new, not sure if it works

* Bounce, TrackCopyTiming, TrackCopySound
  In theory the new track could become the OutSyncMaster and would
  need to start sending clocks.

* SlipForward, SlipBackward, Move
  Need to recalculate the pulse or set dealign.

? Should brothers retrigger when the master retriggers, or do they
  retrigger on their own?  

? The "InternalPulses" in the Loop and the "SyncPulses" in the
  layer are confusing.  Shouldn't the pulse count always come
  from the layer?

Sync Issues
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sync=Out,Pause

What is the desired behavior when you pause the master track or
the slave tracks individually.  What about all globally?

Sync=In,Start/Continue

What happens when Start/StopContinue events are sent from the external
device during Record mode?  Difficult to sync back up, will just
get a random pulse count?

Sync=Any, Record over existing loop

When Record is done over a loop that is not reset, we'll close off the last
layer and save it for undo. Do we?  This may confuse the synchronizer,
must we reset the loop before entering Synchronize mode?

Sync=Any, Threshold Record

Think about how ThresholdMode interacts with SynchronizeMode
