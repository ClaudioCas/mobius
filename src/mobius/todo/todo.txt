
Script autoload as a global parameter rather than in the script.

Recent Bugs
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Min/Max tempo were both 20 for awhile, detect and fix at startup.

Bernhard: June 1, 2009
  Changing Mainstage buffer size and then recording in Mobius causes crash.

Bernhard: June 12
  Can't record on more than one focused lock track, only goes to the first one.

Konakka: June 12
  Problems changing tracks with time copy and not being in sync.

Berhard: June 12
  Mono mode not active until you restart Mobius.

Varius: June 19
  Bounce only getting one track.

Mac Bidule: AU and VST having the same name confuses the right click menu

OLD NOTES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

> By the way, a common additional step for volume indicators is to not lower
> the meter's peak display immediately when the value goes down.  Instead, use
> a counter (or function) that lets it slowly slide down to the latest value
> (resetting that counter every time the peak goes higher than what it is
> currently displaying).  I've read that 300 milliseconds is (or used to be) a
> common time for the meter to return to zero after peaking.

New Features

- flattening without recording, does it do anything?  seem to keep accumulating
  layers if you do Shuffle a lot and just let it play
  !! need something that forces flattening of a new layer even if there
  are no overdubs

- stop using stack buffers when flattening layers, there is a max of 
  around 16 to 20 layers before you get a stack overflow on Mac

- "remember" mode for mute

- DL4 play once script in the files area
 
- not tracking faders when moving move than one at the same time

- key commands don't work in Mainstage 2

- shuffle applied to the current cycle rather than the entire loop

- redesign and fix Bounce
  - options to reset source tracks

- revisit quicksave, make it more obvoius where the files go

* Louis' Adrenelinn configurations

- Monitor Audio Input needs to be track specific 
  - instead of global or in addition to global?

- make sure Mobius can arm tracks for play and
  start the MIDI clocks at the same time

* When the layer list overflows and goes to "loss" numbers, the 
  little red number "1" sticks around.

thanx Per one thing im still trying to get to work with mobius is the
midi sync stuff like MuteQuantMidiStartSong ,midi start song midi stop
song when mobius is set to out user start,it does not seem to be very
reliable specially the mute +midi start song which is equal to the
EDPs MuteQuantMidiStartSong.If you mess around with the midi start
stop and the press the mute +midi start song it works in the beginning
and at one point it will get stucked and do nothing,it also behaves
different than the EDP which you can press at anytime and it sends
both a mute on the loop and stop on the drum machine and starts both
at the next loops start point and i love that function,so anybody whos
into midi sync here do a hard acid test and tell me if works reliable
for you!  would this work better with a script and if it does can you
guys send me one to try out?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

- should we allow track/midi sync master to be set in an empty track?

something in the track strip to show which loops are non-empty

Luis: wants a loop created with TrackCopy=Timing to be in a different
color to indiciate that it is empty.  

jerparise: Mac: MIDI in sync freezes when ending record 

redo latency selection and make sure it works

* fix numbers displayed on remultiply

Intermittent Errors
******************************************************************

Jump Tests: Test 3 - Basic Rates
  Thread::run caught exception

  Saw this once after running several of the full suites.
  Saw this after one of the mute tests, I think rates may have been involved.

Segment Tests: Test 17-2 - Insert over Overdub
  ERROR: Invalid trace record

  Saw this in the full suite, can't reproduce...

Out Sync Tests: Test 5-2
  INFO: Sync drift -16
  ERROR: Sync drift -476 exceeds 300
  ...
  Consistent drift higher than usual, doesn't fail in isolation

Auto Record
  Saw these after playing around with AutoRecord and Undo

  ERROR: 101 248543: Loop: Entering Play mode without a layer!
  ERROR: 101 248799: Loop: Record length anomoly
  ERROR: 101 248832: Loop: Record length anomoly

Load File
  Saw this a lot after loading a loop file:

  ERROR: 101 216287: WARNING: Raising priority of potential track sync master!

  Project/loop load probably needs to reclaculate track sync master.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

After correction bugs, rapid rate shifts at the same time as
rapid unquantized loop switches.

Could be:

   1) record loop, set rate
   2) switch to empty loop, change rate
   3) return to original loop, new rate in effect!
   4) corrects cursor?

No, getting lagging correction when switching to a rate adjusted
loop to an empty loop.  Getting two of them.

When setting a loop to a rate, switching to an empty loop, 
changing rate, then returning to original loop, get this:

  ERROR: 102 169: shift: no record layer

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Script Issues
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a pair of these in a script, the second one doesn't work, 
have to use a pair of "Wait start" instead.

   Wait end
   Wait end

Consider a "Wait events" to wait for all events scheduled on the current
frame to be processed, regardless of what they are.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO: Replace the mReverseRecord, mDeferredFadeLeft, and mDeferredFadeRight
flags with:

  mDeferredFadeLeftIn	(entered this layer forward)
  mDeferredFadeLeftOut  (left this layer in reverse)
  mDeferredFadeRightIn  (entered this layer in reverse)
  mDeferredFadeRightOut (left this layer forward)

This should simplify reverse logic, and allow us to change direction
during recording?  Direction changes would force fades though.
