PackageMaker seeems to be stupid about adding new files without rebilding
the entire fucking thing.  So Mobius 2-2.pmdoc was added to pick
up osc.xml.  I left the original Mobius 2.pmdoc around for reference
but it can be deleted.  Remember to use 2-2 !

.pkg files left in this directory were generated by PackageMaker and
are NOT checked into source control.
