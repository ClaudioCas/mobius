Be sure to set the version numbers propertly before making the package.
Edit mac/bundles/component/Info.plist and mac/bundles/vst/Info.plist
and change the version numbers.  Also edit VstMain.cpp and AUMobius.cpp
and change the #defines with the bundle ids to match.  Failing to do this
will cause the "window full of question marks" since the bundle directory
with the message catalog can't be located.

PackageMaker notes

Build the makefile.mac target "packages".  This will create the
mobius-packages directory.

Run PackageMaker from /Developer/Applications/Utilities/PackageMaker.

Open the project ...mobius/src/mobius/mac/pkgmaker/Mobius 2.pmdoc

Build and run to test.  Build leaves result in mac/pkgmaker/Mobius 2.pkg.

Use Yummy FTP to upload .pkg.
