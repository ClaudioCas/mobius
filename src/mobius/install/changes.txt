- Loop Windowing!

- Script action buttons always behaving like !momentary scripts

  then conflict with custom bindings.

Display of "Beats per Bar" weird with mouse.

Fixed dispalay of InputPort and several other parameters.  Anything

When the Ableton transport is playing a loop, the rewind to the start
is now being propertly recognized as a beat or bar boundary for Mobius
synchronization.

Distribute osc.xml file, fix a crash if the file is missing.

Slow memory leak on Mac when drawing text in the UI.  

Large Memory leak if Max Redo Count is more than 1.

Binding dialogs will now show the configured number of tracks and
groups in the scope selector rather than always showing 8 tracks
and 4 groups.
