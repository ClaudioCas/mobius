
Release 1.40 added support for complex shuffle patterns.  This feature
is only available from scripts.  Binding MIDI event to the standard
Shuffle function uses Shuffle Mode to determine the pattern and
works has it did before.

When using Shuffle in a sript, you follow the keyword with
a list of arguments. For example:

   Shuffle 8 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

The first argument is the number of "granules" the loop will
be cut into.  In this example the loop is cut into 8 even sized
granules.

The rest of the arguments are the "shuffle pattern".  In the simplest
case these the granule numbers starting from 1.  The pattern 
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 simply plays all 8 granules in order which would
sound the same as the original loop.  This pattern reverses
the order of the granules:  

  8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1

There may one element in the shuffle pattern for each granule.  If
you have fewer pattern elements than granules the pattern will
be repeated.  For example this:

    Shuffle 8 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4

is the same as:

    Shuffle 8 1,2,3,4

You may repeat granules any number of times.  

    Shuffle 8 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2

To leave gaps in the pattern where nothing is audible use number 0.

    Shuffle 8 1,0,3,0,5,0,7,0

Besides granule numbers you may use these letters:

    r - select a random granule
    u - select a random granule that has not been used
    p - use the previous granule

The difference between "r" and "u" is that "u" will never select
a granule that has already been used in the pattern.  For example
this pattern:

    Shuffle 4 r

Could result in the pattern 1,2,2,4 because duplicates are allowed.
But this pattern:

    Shuffle 4 u

will never have duplicate granules.

The "p" symbol is most useful when next to "r" or "u".  For example,
this selects a granule at random and repeats the same granule 3 times.

   Shuffle 4 r,p,p,p

Each element in the shuffe pattern separated by a comma is called
a "pattern element".  A pattern element may also be a list of values:

   Shuffle 4 (1,2,3),(2,3,4)

Lists are surrounded by () or [] and have elements separated with commas.
When a pattern element is a list, it means to select one of the list
elements at random.  So in the previous example the loop is divided into 
4 granules.  The first granule of the new loop will have granule 1, 2, or 3
of the original loop selected at random.  The second granule of the new
loop will have granule 2, 3, or 4 of the original loop selected at random.

Within a pattern element list you may have another level of nesting to
specify the probability of selecting the granule:

    ((1,.5),(2,.25),(3,.25))

In this pattern there is a 50% probability of selecting granule 1, 
and a 25% probability of selecting either granule 2 or 3.

You may use the r, u, and p symbols here too:

    ((1,.75),(r,.25))

In this pattern there is a 75% chance of selecting granule 1 and
a 25% chance of selecting any other granule at random.

As a shorthand, it is not necessary to specify a percentage in the
last element of a pattern element list:

   ((1,.75),r)

Since there are only 2 elements in the list and the first as a 75% probability
we now that "r" will have a 25% probability and it does not have to be written.
