Various old documents or posts.

mobiusdoc.xml and scripts.xml were the official documentation
until the reorganization in 2010.

design.xml was an ancient attempt at starting a design document.
I haven't looked at it in a long time, there may still be something
interesting in here but the design is WAY beyond this now.
