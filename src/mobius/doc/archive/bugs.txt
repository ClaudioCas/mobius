This file contains a list of some of the more obvious Mobius bugs.
You are encouraged to read this before you start using Mobius so you
have some idea of what to expect.  If you find something that isn't
listed here, please report it to jeff@zonemobius.com.

The bugs are divided into two sections, those related to the UI and
those related to the looping engine.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
User Interface Bugs
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2 The space key triggers the last selected button in addition to the
  function bound to the space key.

  This is a Windows feature for automatic selection of buttons.
  Need to find a way to disable that.

3 If we can't open the audio devices (like when an instance of
  Mobius is already running), no error dialog is displayed.

4 Maximize, then restore window, not doing a relayout

6 When saving loops in the Save Loop dialog, if you type in a filename
  without an extension, it is saved without an extension, need to
  be setting the extension based on the selected file type
  (normally .wav).

Looping Engine Bugs
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2 Save Layers option not saving internal layers

  Internal layers are sometimes synthesized to represent complex
  modifications like an insert.  These are not linked in to the undo layer
  list and are not being saved.  You will not be able to fully recover
  the project if there were internal layers.

3 Loading a project with segments not properly resolving layer ids

  Avoid saving and loading projects with the <i>Save Layers</i> option.

5 Adjusting feedback up while playing results in an audible
  "bump" in the middle of the layer.

6 SaveRecordedAudio function may cause audio interrupt overruns

  This needs to be performed in a thread outside the audio interrupt.

7 files with spaces can't be loaded from a .mob file

8 AutoRecord=On, Record/Switch (full loop)
  This is supposed to unconditionally re-record the next loop, it doesn't.

9 Threshold > 0, RecordMode=Sustain, Record

  If RecordMode=Sustain, then the down transition arms the recording 
  and the up transition is ignored.  After the threshold is reached
  another down transition stops the recording, but the up transition 
  immediately starts a new recording.  Need to either ignore up transition
  if the down transition of a SUS record ends a recording OR
  ignore the down transition if we're in a SUS record.

10 Record, Switch, Undo
   Supposed to cancel the pending transition, undoes the entire layer.

11 SamplerStyle=Once, MIDI Trigger
   Loop is supposed to play once then mute, doesn't mute.

12 SamplerStyle=Once, Switch, Insert
   ReTrigger but eventually return.  Losing returning event,
   going into insert mode.

13 SamplerStyle=Once, Switch, Overdub
   Supposed to enable overdub and stay in next loop.  Not enabling
   overdub and returning.

14 SamplerStyle=Once, NextLoop, NextLoop
   Supposed to stack two NextLoop events, instead just incrementing
   the loop number of the first switch.
   If wait until after the first switch to do the next one, 
   we return to the second loop, but lose the return to the first loop

15 SamplerStyle=Once, Switch, Record
   Record a new loop and stay there.  Recording, but not canceling return.

16 Overdub/Switch
   Supposed to remember overdub when returning to loop, but it is lost.

17 Replace/Switch
   End replace, start switch.  If LoopCopy is on, not getting the
   replaced content into the copy, copying from the play layer
   rather than the record layer.
